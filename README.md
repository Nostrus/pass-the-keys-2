# Tic Tac Toe

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `ng serve --open` to serve the app.

- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.
- Instead of adding a library for the design, I simply went for a flex layout, material design colors, and unicode characters as the marks (see `config.ts`).
- The Grid component contains the main game logic.
- The App component and its child StatusMessage component are responsible for displaying status messages.
- The Square component only displays the marks and handles click events.
